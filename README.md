# Beat Oven

Make beats with friends without messing up each other's files.

What it is
- A desktop app that keeps one clean Main version of a project and a Local sandbox for each person.
- No central file server. You pull the Main from a friend who's online. Only the project owner decides when a Local becomes the new Main.

How it works (quick)
- Main = the shared version on your machine
- Local = your space to try stuff (`local/<you>/`)
- Pull = grab the latest Main from someone online
- Promote (owner) = turn a Local into the new Main (old Main gets backed up)

Why bother
- Fewer "who overwrote what?" moments
- Files live on your machines, not ours
- Hashes tell you if you're up to date

MVP features
- Finds projects in your chosen folder
- One-click Pull from an online collaborator
- Local snapshots + backups of old Mains
- Simple roles (Owner/Collaborator) and presence
- Ignore rules to skip caches/temp files

Status
- Early MVP. It works for simple collabs; expect rough edges.

What's next
- Faster pulls for big projects
- Better networking for tricky home routers
- A way for collaborators to propose a promotion
